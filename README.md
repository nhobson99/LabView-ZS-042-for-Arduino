# LabView-ZS-042-for-Arduino
A package for the ZS-042 I2C module using the Arduino package library. Will not work on LYNX.

The file arduinoReadClock is the one that actually does all the work. An example file is provided as arduinoClockTest. All files are necessary for this library to work. Not currently packaged in the VI Package Manager, but it will be once I iron out some more bugs. Should supposedly also work for the DS-3231, though I don't have one to test.
